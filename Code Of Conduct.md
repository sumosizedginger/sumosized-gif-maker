# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be a decent human. That's it.

## The Actual Version

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) v2.1.

### We Expect

- Respectful, constructive feedback
- Openness to different approaches and ideas
- Helping newcomers get oriented without condescension

### We Don't Tolerate

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Gatekeeping or elitism
- Spam, self-promotion, or off-topic noise in issues/PRs

### Enforcement

Violations can be reported by opening a private security advisory (same channel as security reports). Repeat or egregious offenses result in a permanent ban from the repo.

This is a small open source tool, not a political forum. Keep it about the code.
